# Milestone 3 - Invite a Participant to Your Uni
In this section, you will ask one of your colleagues to join your existing single-node Uni

## Find a Partner
Find a partner to collaborate with.  One of you should be the invitation "Sender", the other the invitation "Recipient".  

## Invite Participants
The Sender will invite the Recipient to join the single-node Uni from Milestone 1, using the Share UI.   The Recipient will receive the invitation and join the Uni. 

**NOTE:** The Share CLI also allows for invitations to be sent using `share uni invite`.

The Recipient will get to choose the Region in which its Node will be created (it does not have to be in the same Region as the Sender's Node).

Once the Recipient succeeds in accepting the invitation, a new Node will be created in about 5 minutes.

Once both parties have joined the Uni, use the GraphQL Explorer to examine the Heroes and Villains available
