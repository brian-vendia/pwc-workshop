# Milestone 3 - Invite a Participant to Your Uni
In this section, you will ask one of your colleagues to join an existing Uni

## Explore the /invitations directory
The `Invites.md` files contains a mapping of Senders and Recipients.  

## Invite Participants
Each Sender will invite the corresponding Recipient to join one of its Unis, using the Share UI.   The Recipient will receive the invitation and join the Uni. 

The Recipient will get to choose the Region in which its Node will be created (it does not have to be in the same Region as the Sender's Node).

Once the Recipient succeeds in accepting the invitation, a new Node will be created in about 5 minutes.

Once both parties have joined the Uni, use the GraphQL Explorer to examine the Heroes and Villains available

## Explore the Node Configuration that you can see and that your collaborating Participant can see
* What configuration info do you see for your Node?
* What configuration info do you see for your collaborator's Node?
* What configuration does your collaborator see for your Node?
* What configuration does your collaborator see for their own Node?
